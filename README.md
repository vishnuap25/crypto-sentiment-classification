**Key Features**

✅ Preprocessed dataset with labeled sentiment (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive)
✅ Machine learning and deep learning approaches for text classification
✅ Data augmentation techniques to improve model performance
✅ Future predictions on real-time or batch text data


**Use Cases**
📢 Social media sentiment analysis
💬 Customer feedback classification
⚠️ Automated content moderation

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLP techniques
🔹 Next Steps: Model optimization, real-time deployment**
